Dumping and restoring database

When database schema is changed the easiest way to update uguu to a new version
is to drop database, create a new one and rescan each share. Because this would
take a significant amount of time, dumping/restoring mechanism has been created.


Dumping

First you need to install 'sqlscan' scanner to your 'bin' directory in
the uguu tree. This could be done by typing 'make install' in the sqlscan
directory.
Second you need to create 'save' directory in your 'bin' directory and put
'dump.py' in the 'bin' directory.
Then dump filelists for all shares from your database by typing
'python dump.py'


Restoring

Restoring can be done by a slightly modified version of the spider. Patch can
be applied by typing command 'patch -p2 < ../misc/save/spider.py.patch'
in the 'bin' directory. For Windows, use spider.py.win32.patch instead.
Then database shares table should be prepared for total rescan: execute
SQL command "UPDATE shares SET state='online', next_scan=now();"
and drop tables` paths and files indexes. Then, run the patched 'spider.py'
script. For each share it will get contents from the directory 'save'
instead of executing a scanner as usual. Finally, execute SQL command:
"UPDATE shares SET next_scan=last_scan + interval '12 hours' WHERE last_scan IS NOT NULL"
and restore previously dropped indexes.
