Dumping and restoring database

When database schema is changed easiest way to update uguu to new version is
to empty database and rescan each share. Because this would take a significant
amount of thime dumping/restoring mechanism have been created.


Dumping

First you need to install 'sqlscan' scanner to your 'bin' directory in
the uguu tree. This could be done by typing 'make install' in the sqlscan
directory.
Second you need to create 'save' directory in yor 'bin' directory and put
'dump.py' coming with this archive in 'bin' directory.
Then dump file lists for all shares from your database by typing
'python dump.py'


Restoring

Restoring is done by a slightly modified version of the spider. Patch is
attached and can be applied by typing command 'patch -p1 < spider.py.patch'
in 'bin' directory. For Windows, use spider.py.win32.patch instead.
Then database shares table should be prepared for updating all shares: execute
SQL command "UPDATE shares SET state='online', hash='', next_scan=now();".
Finally, run the patched 'spider.py' script, for each share it will get
contents from the directory 'save' instead of executing corresponding scanner.
